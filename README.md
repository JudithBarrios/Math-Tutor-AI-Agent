SmartStudyBot is an interactive, beginner-friendly AI math tutor that helps users practice arithmetic problems through text-based interactions. The tutor generates questions, provides hints, evaluates answers, and gives personalized feedback to help users understand their mistakes and improve over time.

This project was created for the Capstone Project in ITAI2376 and demonstrates concepts such as language-based planning, reinforcement learning elements (via feedback and improvement), and decision-making, all without using external APIs.
